# IBM watsonx day watsonx.ai lab

Welcome to our technical lab session. We'll delve into the essentials of prompt engineering utilizing the watsonx.ai tool. As we progress, you'll get an in-depth look at the features of the LangChain library and an introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). During the lab, you'll also gain insights into what Large Language Models (LLM) are, their impressive capabilities, and the art of effectively communicating with them. Moreover, this workshop will provide you with a hands-on experience, allowing you to familiarize yourself with the structure of the watsonx.ai tool which is part of the watsonx platform - an IBM tool that enables work with generative artificial intelligence.
