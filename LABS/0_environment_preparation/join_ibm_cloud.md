### Join IBM Cloud
If you are the owner of the watsonx.ai SaaS environment or it has been shared with you, you should expect two messages in your mailbox. One of the messages comes from IBM Technology Zone and the other from IBM Cloud. In this case, we are particularly interested in the second one - from IBM Cloud.
