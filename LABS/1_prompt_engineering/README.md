# Laboratory 1
Welcome to the first part of the laboratory dedicated to the watsonx.ai platform.

In this part, we will get acquainted with the basic concepts related to large language models, familiarize ourselves with the project structure in watsonx.ai, and also learn about prompt engineering methods.

### Note
Before starting the laboratory, make sure you have access to the watsonx.ai platform:


```
https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/wx/home?context=wx
```

Log in to the region

```
Dallas
```

And make sure you are using an account named
