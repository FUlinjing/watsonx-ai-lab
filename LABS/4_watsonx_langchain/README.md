# Lab 4

LangChain and IBM's Watson Machine Learning Python Library

## Introduction
LangChain is a popular framework for developing applications powered by LLMs. The LangChain team's goal is to make connecting multiple calls between LLMs easier to code while adding functionality for templates, input/output parsing, history management, agents and integrating the models with external APIs

## Get Started

Implementation of the laboratory requires preparation of its environment.
- having your api key and project id (if you haven't generated api_key and project_id before starting the lab, do it [here](/LABS/0_environment_preparation/prepare_apikey_and_projectid.md))
  
  
To start the lab, download jupyter notebook located [here](/LABS/4_watsonx_langchain/)
