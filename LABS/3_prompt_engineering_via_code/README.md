# Lab 3

Welcome to the third part of the lab on prompt engineering.

In this section, we will learn how to integrate watsonx.ai SaaS with external code. In our case, this will be Python code.

Implementation of the laboratory requires preparation of its environment.
- having your api key and project id (if you haven't generated api_key and project_id before starting the lab, do it [here](/LABS/0_environment_preparation/prepare_apikey_and_projectid.md))


To start the lab, download jupyter notebook located [here](/LABS/3_prompt_engineering_via_code/)
